# MiramoreApp Online Shop

This project is a basic single page application built with Angular as a Front-End framework and Firebase as a Back-End . 

Its core features include:

user creation;
user roles(basic and administrator);
creating new products;
editing and deleting existing products;
buying products;
making orders;

## Idea

## Built with

Angular 6 - JavaScript Front-End Framework
Bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha.6 - HTML/CSS Framework
NPM - Node Package Manager
## To run the project

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
